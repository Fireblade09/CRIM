Hello all,

This project is not revolutionary. It's not that impressive. It's really not that hard. Nonetheless, I'm very proud of it.
This text-based adventure game was created for a coding project for my Discrete Mathematics class. Simple. Prior to coming to uni, I had absolutely no experience with coding. I haven't even been coding for a full year, so don't expect anything incredible...yet.

So, here is my game. Make sure you have pygame, put the map.txt file in a folder named "Resources", then run game.py. Let me know what you think!
